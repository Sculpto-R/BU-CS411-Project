## ‚û§ About
iNNiT? is a Python-based service that locates events in London via website information. This app was developed in the BU London Fall '25 period for CAS CS 411.


#### ‚äù Goals & Objectives:

Help young adults in London find local community events and entertainment based on their listed personal preferences via filtered website information. 


#### ‚äù This App vs. Others:

Focused on more contemporary and ‚Äúunderground‚Äù events (parties, shows, etc.) that are not as publicized as musicals, lectures, etc. (ex. Those publicized on Eventbrite). 


#### ‚äù Specifications:

iNNiT? is a web-based program mapping London community events and entertainment based on those posted on social media (specifically Instagram and TikTok). It uses a profile system to distinguish interests and preferences when searching events and filters out certain events based on user‚Äôs preferences. AI sifts through social media posts with these key words entered by the user and location keywords.
